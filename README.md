Overview
This project is a full-stack web application developed as a clone of Airbnb using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It aims to replicate the core functionality of Airbnb, allowing users to search for accommodations, view details, make bookings, and manage their listings.
